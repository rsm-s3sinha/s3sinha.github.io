    "text": "Experimental Results\n\nCharitable Contribution Made\nFirst, I analyze whether matched donations lead to an increased response rate of making a donation.\ntodo: make a barplot with two bars. Each bar is the proportion of people who donated. One bar for treatment and one bar for control.\ntodo: run a t-test between the treatment and control groups on the binary outcome of whether any charitable donation was made. Also run a bivariate linear regression that demonstrates the same finding. (It may help to confirm your calculations match Table 2a Panel A.) Report your statistical results and interpret them in the context of the experiment (e.g., if you found a difference with a small p-value or that was statistically significant at some threshold, what have you learned about human behavior? Use mostly English words, not numbers or stats, to explain your finding.)\ntodo: run a probit regression where the outcome variable is whether any charitable donation was made and the explanatory variable is assignment to treatment or control. Confirm that your results replicate Table 3 column 1 in the paper.\n\n\nDifferences between Match Rates\nNext, I assess the effectiveness of different sizes of matched donations on the response rate.\ntodo: Use a series of t-tests to test whether the size of the match ratio has an effect on whether people donate or not. For example, does the 2:1 match rate lead increase the likelihood that someone donates as compared to the 1:1 match rate? Do your results support the “figures suggest” comment the authors make on page 8?\ntodo: Assess the same issue using a regression. Specifically, create the variable ratio1 then regress gave on ratio1, ratio2, and ratio3 (or alternatively, regress gave on the categorical variable ratio). Interpret the coefficients and their statistical precision.\ntodo: Calculate the response rate difference between the 1:1 and 2:1 match ratios and the 2:1 and 3:1 ratios. Do this directly from the data, and do it by computing the differences in the fitted coefficients of the previous regression. what do you conclude regarding the effectiveness of different sizes of matched donations?\n\n\nSize of Charitable Contribution\nIn this subsection, I analyze the effect of the size of matched donation on the size of the charitable contribution.\ntodo: Calculate a t-test or run a bivariate linear regression of the donation amount on the treatment status. What do we learn from doing this analysis?\ntodo: now limit the data to just people who made a donation and repeat the previous analysis. This regression allows you to analyze how much respondents donate conditional on donating some positive amount. Interpret the regression coefficients – what did we learn? Does the treatment coefficient have a causal interpretation?\ntodo: Make two plot: one for the treatment group and one for the control. Each plot should be a histogram of the donation amounts only among people who donated. Add a red vertical bar or some other annotation to indicate the sample average for each plot."

To do this, you will simulate 100,00 draws from the control distribution and 10,000 draws from the treatment distribution. You’ll then calculate a vector of 10,000 differences, and then you’ll plot the cumulative average of that vector of differences. Comment on whether the cumulative average approaches the true difference in means.\n\n\nCentral Limit Theorem\nto do: Make 4 histograms like those on slide 44 from our first class at sample sizes 50, 200, 500, and 1000 and explain these plots to the reader. To do this for a sample size of e.g. 50, take 50 draws from each of the control and treatment distributions, and calculate the average difference between those draws. Then repeat that process 999 more times so that you have 1000 averages. Plot the histogram of those averages. Comment on whether zero is in the “middle” of the distribution or whether it’s in the “tail.”"

For example, does the 2:1 match rate lead increase the likelihood that someone donates as compared to the 1:1 match rate? Do your results support the “figures suggest” comment the authors make on page 8?\n\n# T-test between 1:1 match rate and 2:1 match rate\ngave_ratio1 = karlan_list[karlan_list['ratio'] == 1]['gave']\ngave_ratio2 = karlan_list[karlan_list['ratio2'] == 1]['gave']\nt_stat_1_vs_2, p_value_1_vs_2 = stats.ttest_ind(gave_ratio1, gave_ratio2, equal_var=False)\n\n# T-test between 1:1 match rate and 3:1 match rate\ngave_ratio3 = karlan_list[karlan_list['ratio3'] == 1]['gave']\nt_stat_1_vs_3, p_value_1_vs_3 = stats.ttest_ind(gave_ratio1, gave_ratio3, equal_var=False)\n\n# T-test between 2:1 match rate and 3:1 match rate\nt_stat_2_vs_3, p_value_2_vs_3 = stats.ttest_ind(gave_ratio2, gave_ratio3, equal_var=False)\n\n# Output the results\nprint(f\"1:1 vs 2:1 T-test statistic: {t_stat_1_vs_2}, P-value: {p_value_1_vs_2}\")\nprint(f\"1:1 vs 3:1 T-test statistic: {t_stat_1_vs_3}, P-value: {p_value_1_vs_3}\")\nprint(f\"2:1 vs 3:1 T-test statistic: {t_stat_2_vs_3}, P-value: {p_value_2_vs_3}\")\n\n1:1 vs 2:1 T-test statistic: -0.965048975142932, P-value: 0.33453078237183076\n1:1 vs 3:1 T-test statistic: -1.0150174470156275, P-value: 0.31010856527625774\n2:1 vs 3:1 T-test statistic: -0.05011581369764474, P-value: 0.9600305476940865\n\n\ntodo: Assess the same issue using a regression. Specifically, create the variable ratio1 then regress gave on ratio1, ratio2, and ratio3 (or alternatively, regress gave on the categorical variable ratio). Interpret the coefficients and their statistical precision.\ntodo: Calculate the response rate difference between the 1:1 and 2:1 match ratios and the 2:1 and 3:1 ratios. Do this directly from the data, and do it by computing the differences in the fitted coefficients of the previous regression. what do you conclude regarding the effectiveness of different sizes of matched donations?\n\n\nSize of Charitable Contribution\nIn this subsection, I analyze the effect of the size of matched donation on the size of the charitable contribution.\ntodo: Calculate a t-test or run a bivariate linear regression of the donation amount on the treatment status. What do we learn from doing this analysis?\n\n# T-test on the amount donated between control and treatment groups\namount_control = karlan_list[karlan_list['control'] == 1]['amount']\namount_treatment = karlan_list[karlan_list['treatment'] == 1]['amount']\nt_stat, p_value = stats.ttest_ind(amount_control, amount_treatment, equal_var=False)\n\n# Bivariate Linear Regression of amount on treatment status\nX = sm.add_constant(karlan_list['treatment'])\ny = karlan_list['amount']\nmodel = sm.OLS(y, X).fit()\n\n# Print the t-test results\nprint(f\"T-test statistic: {t_stat}, P-value: {p_value}\")\n\nprint(model.summary())\n\nT-test statistic: -1.9182618934467577, P-value: 0.05508566528918335\n                            OLS Regression Results                            \n==============================================================================\nDep.

Both distributions are right-skewed, indicating that most firms have a relatively small number of patents, but some firms have significantly more.\nMean Number of Patents: Non-Customers: The mean number of patents is approximately 3.62. Customers: The mean number of patents is higher, at approximately 4.09. Blueprinty customers are not selected at random. It may be important to account for systematic differences in the age and regional location of customers vs non-customers.\n\n\n\n\nimport seaborn as sns\n\n# Plot distribution of regions by customer status\nplt.figure(figsize = (12, 6))\nplt.subplot(1, 2, 1)\nsns.countplot(data = blueprinty, x = 'region', hue = 'iscustomer', palette = 'Set1')\nplt.title('Distribution of Regions by Customer Status')\nplt.xticks(rotation = 45)\nplt.xlabel('Region')\nplt.ylabel('Count')\n\n# Plot distribution of age by customer status\nplt.subplot(1, 2, 2)\nsns.boxplot(data = blueprinty, x = 'iscustomer', y = 'age', palette = 'Set2')\nplt.title('Distribution of Age by Customer Status')\nplt.xlabel('Customer Status (0 = Non-Customer, 1 = Customer)')\nplt.ylabel('Age since Incorporation')\n\nplt.tight_layout()\nplt.show()\n\n/tmp/ipykernel_52250/2605947089.py:14: FutureWarning:\n\n\n\nPassing `palette` without assigning `hue` is deprecated and will be removed in v0.14.0. Assign the `x` variable to `hue` and set `legend=False` for the same effect.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFrom the analysis of age and regional distributions by customer status, we observe the following:\nAge Distribution: The boxplots show that firms using Blueprinty’s software (Is Customer = 1) tend to be younger compared to those not using the software. The mean age for customers is approximately 24.15 years, while for non-customers, it’s about 26.69 years. This indicates a systematic difference in the age of firms, where younger firms are more likely to be customers of Blueprinty.\nRegional Distribution: The count plots reveal some differences in regional preferences or presence for customers and non-customers. Some regions show a more pronounced disparity between the number of customers and non-customers, which could indicate regional market penetration or preferences affecting the adoption of Blueprinty’s software.\n\n\n\n\nSince our outcome variable of interest can only be small integer values per a set unit of time, we can use a Poisson density to model the number of patents awarded to each engineering firm over the last 5 years. We start by estimating a simple Poisson model via Maximum Likelihood.\ntodo: Write down mathematically the likelihood for \\(Y \\sim \\text{Poisson}(\\lambda)\\). Note that \\(f(Y|\\lambda) = e^{-\\lambda}\\lambda^Y/Y!\\).\nWhere:\n𝑒 is the base of the natural logarithm. 𝜆 is a positive real number. 𝑌 is the number of occurrences (a non-negative integer). 𝑌! denotes the factorial of 𝑌\nFor computational purposes, especially with larger datasets or larger values of 𝑌, it’s practical to work with the log-likelihood because it transforms products into sums, which are numerically more stable. The log-likelihood of the Poisson distribution is: \\[\n\\log L(\\lambda \\mid Y) = \\log(f(Y \\mid \\lambda)) = Y \\log(\\lambda) - \\lambda - \\log(Y!)\n\\]\n\n\n\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef poisson_loglikelihood(lambda_, Y):\n    # Ensure Y is an array for vector operations\n    Y = np.asarray(Y)\n    log_factorial_Y = np.log(np.arange(1, Y.max() + 1)).cumsum()\n\n    # Compute the log-likelihood\n    log_likelihood = np.sum(Y * np.log(lambda_) - lambda_ - np.where(Y &gt; 0, log_factorial_Y[Y - 1], 0))\n    return log_likelihood\n\n# Example use of the function with hypothetical lambda and Y\nlambda_example = 3.5  # example lambda value\nY_example = [0, 2, 3, 1, 0]  # example data points\n\n# Calculate the log-likelihood\nlog_likelihood_value = poisson_loglikelihood(lambda_example, Y_example)\nprint(\"Log-likelihood:\", log_likelihood_value)\n\nLog-likelihood: -12.468328838815792\n\n\nUsing likelihood function to plot lambda on the horizontal axis and the likelihood (or log-likelihood) on the vertical axis for a range of lambdas (use the observed number of patents as the input for Y)\n\n# Extract the 'patents' column from the blueprinty DataFrame for use as Y\nY_patents = blueprinty['patents'].values\n\n# Define a range of lambda values for plotting\nlambda_values = np.linspace(0.1, 10, 400)\n\n# Compute log-likelihood values for each lambda\nlog_likelihood_values = [poisson_loglikelihood(lmbda, Y_patents) for lmbda in lambda_values]\n\n# Plotting\nplt.figure(figsize=(10, 6))\nplt.plot(lambda_values, log_likelihood_values, label='Log-Likelihood', color='blue')\nplt.title('Log-Likelihood of Poisson Model for Various Lambda Values')\nplt.xlabel('Lambda (λ)')\nplt.ylabel('Log-Likelihood')\nplt.grid(True)\nplt.legend()\nplt.show()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFinding the MLE by optimizing the likelihood function with optim() in R or sp.optimize() in Python\n\nfrom scipy.optimize import minimize\n\n# Define the negative of the log-likelihood function since we need to minimize it\ndef negative_poisson_loglikelihood(lambda_, Y):\n    Y = np.asarray(Y)\n    log_factorial_Y = np.log(np.arange(1, Y.max() + 1)).cumsum()\n    return -np.sum(Y * np.log(lambda_) - lambda_ - np.where(Y &gt; 0, log_factorial_Y[Y - 1], 0))\n\n# Initial guess for lambda\ninitial_lambda = 1\n\n# Use scipy's minimize function to find the lambda that minimizes the negative log-likelihood\nresult = minimize(negative_poisson_loglikelihood, initial_lambda, args=(Y_patents,), bounds=[(0.1, None)])\n\n# The optimal lambda found\noptimal_lambda = result.x[0]\nresult.fun, optimal_lambda\n\n(3367.6837722351083, 3.68466641206125)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNext, we extend our simple Poisson model to a Poisson Regression Model such that \\(Y_i = \\text{Poisson}(\\lambda_i)\\) where \\(\\lambda_i = \\exp(X_i'\\beta)\\). The interpretation is that the success rate of patent awards is not constant across all firms (\\(\\lambda\\)) but rather is a function of firm characteristics \\(X_i\\). Specifically, we will use the covariates age, age squared, region, and whether the firm is a customer of Blueprinty.\nUpdating the log-likelihood function with an additional argument to take in a covariate matrix X. Also changing the parameter of the model from lambda to the beta vector. In this model, lambda must be a positive number, so we choose the inverse link function g() to be exp() so that_ \\(\\lambda_i = e^{X_i'\\beta}\\).\n\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef poisson_regression_loglikelihood(beta, Y, X):\n\n    # Compute lambda_i for each observation\n    lambda_i = np.exp(X @ beta)\n    \n    # Precompute log(Y!) for each unique Y, assuming Y is non-negative integer\n    max_Y = np.max(Y)\n    log_factorial = np.log(np.arange(1, max_Y + 1)).cumsum()\n    log_factorial = np.hstack([0, log_factorial])  # For Y = 0 case\n    \n    # Compute the log-likelihood\n    log_likelihood = Y * np.log(lambda_i) - lambda_i - log_factorial[Y]\n    return -log_likelihood.sum()\n\n# Example usage could include preparing a design matrix X, Y, and an initial beta estimate, then calling an optimizer.\n\nUsing the function along with R’s optim() or Python’s sp.optimize() to find the MLE vector and the Hessian of the Poisson model with covariates.\nSpecifically, the first column of X should be all 1’s to enable a constant term in the model, and the subsequent columns should be age, age squared, binary variables for all but one of the regions, and the binary customer variable.

Age Squared: Negative and statistically significant, indicating a decrease in patent growth rate as firms get older. Region Variables: Differences across regions are observed, with Northeast showing a positive and significant effect. Is Customer: Positive and significant, suggesting that being a Blueprinty customer is associated with a higher count of patents.\nConclusions About Blueprinty’s Software The analysis strongly suggests that Blueprinty’s software has a positive effect on the success rate of patent applications. Firms using Blueprinty’s software tend to have higher patent counts than those that do not, after controlling for other factors like the age of the firm and regional influences. This finding supports the marketing claim that using Blueprinty’s software can enhance a firm’s success in securing patents."

The marketing team would like to use this data to make the claim that firms using Blueprinty’s software are more successful in getting their patent applications approved.\n\n\n\n\nimport pandas as pd\n\n# Load the data files\nblueprinty = pd.read_csv('../../files/blueprinty.csv')\n\nairbnb = pd.read_csv('../../files/airbnb.csv')\n\n\n\n\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n\nplt.figure(figsize = (12, 6))\n\n# Customers\nplt.subplot(1, 2, 1)\nplt.hist(blueprinty[blueprinty['iscustomer'] == 1]['patents'], bins = 20, alpha = 0.7, color = 'blue')\nplt.title('Histogram of Patents - Customers')\nplt.xlabel('Number of Patents')\nplt.ylabel('Frequency')\n\n# Non-Customers\nplt.subplot(1, 2, 2)\nplt.hist(blueprinty[blueprinty['iscustomer'] == 0]['patents'], bins = 20, alpha = 0.7, color = 'red')\nplt.title('Histogram of Patents - Non-Customers')\nplt.xlabel('Number of Patents')\n\nplt.tight_layout()\nplt.show()\n\n# Calculate and print the mean number of patents for both groups\nmean_patent_customers = blueprinty[blueprinty['iscustomer'] == 1]['patents'].mean()\nmean_patent_non_customers = blueprinty[blueprinty['iscustomer'] == 0]['patents'].mean()\nprint(f'The mean no. of patents for custoners: ', mean_patent_customers)\nprint(f'The mean no. of patents for non customers: ', mean_patent_non_customers)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe mean no. of patents for custoners:  4.091370558375634\nThe mean no. of patents for non customers:  3.6231772831926325\n\n\nFrom the histograms and the mean values of patents, we observe the following:\nHistograms: The distribution of patents for customers of Blueprinty (blue) shows a slightly more frequent occurrence of higher patent counts compared to non-customers (green). Both distributions are right-skewed, indicating that most firms have a relatively small number of patents, but some firms have significantly more.\nMean Number of Patents: Non-Customers: The mean number of patents is approximately 3.62. Customers: The mean number of patents is higher, at approximately 4.09. Blueprinty customers are not selected at random. It may be important to account for systematic differences in the age and regional location of customers vs non-customers.\n\n\n\n\nimport seaborn as sns\n\n# Plot distribution of regions by customer status\nplt.figure(figsize = (12, 6))\nplt.subplot(1, 2, 1)\nsns.countplot(data = blueprinty, x = 'region', hue = 'iscustomer', palette = 'Set1')\nplt.title('Distribution of Regions by Customer Status')\nplt.xticks(rotation = 45)\nplt.xlabel('Region')\nplt.ylabel('Count')\n\n# Plot distribution of age by customer status\nplt.subplot(1, 2, 2)\nsns.boxplot(data = blueprinty, x = 'iscustomer', y = 'age', palette = 'Set2')\nplt.title('Distribution of Age by Customer Status')\nplt.xlabel('Customer Status (0 = Non-Customer, 1 = Customer)')\nplt.ylabel('Age since Incorporation')\n\nplt.tight_layout()\nplt.show()\n\n/tmp/ipykernel_52250/2605947089.py:14: FutureWarning:\n\n\n\nPassing `palette` without assigning `hue` is deprecated and will be removed in v0.14.0. Assign the `x` variable to `hue` and set `legend=False` for the same effect.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFrom the analysis of age and regional distributions by customer status, we observe the following:\nAge Distribution: The boxplots show that firms using Blueprinty’s software (Is Customer = 1) tend to be younger compared to those not using the software. The mean age for customers is approximately 24.15 years, while for non-customers, it’s about 26.69 years. This indicates a systematic difference in the age of firms, where younger firms are more likely to be customers of Blueprinty.\nRegional Distribution: The count plots reveal some differences in regional preferences or presence for customers and non-customers. Some regions show a more pronounced disparity between the number of customers and non-customers, which could indicate regional market penetration or preferences affecting the adoption of Blueprinty’s software.\n\n\n\n\nSince our outcome variable of interest can only be small integer values per a set unit of time, we can use a Poisson density to model the number of patents awarded to each engineering firm over the last 5 years. We start by estimating a simple Poisson model via Maximum Likelihood.\ntodo: Write down mathematically the likelihood for \\(Y \\sim \\text{Poisson}(\\lambda)\\). Note that \\(f(Y|\\lambda) = e^{-\\lambda}\\lambda^Y/Y!\\).\nWhere:\n𝑒 is the base of the natural logarithm. 𝜆 is a positive real number. 𝑌 is the number of occurrences (a non-negative integer). 𝑌! denotes the factorial of 𝑌\nFor computational purposes, especially with larger datasets or larger values of 𝑌, it’s practical to work with the log-likelihood because it transforms products into sums, which are numerically more stable. The log-likelihood of the Poisson distribution is: \\[\n\\log L(\\lambda \\mid Y) = \\log(f(Y \\mid \\lambda)) = Y \\log(\\lambda) - \\lambda - \\log(Y!)\n\\]\n\n\n\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef poisson_loglikelihood(lambda_, Y):\n    # Ensure Y is an array for vector operations\n    Y = np.asarray(Y)\n    log_factorial_Y = np.log(np.arange(1, Y.max() + 1)).cumsum()\n\n    # Compute the log-likelihood\n    log_likelihood = np.sum(Y * np.log(lambda_) - lambda_ - np.where(Y &gt; 0, log_factorial_Y[Y - 1], 0))\n    return log_likelihood\n\n# Example use of the function with hypothetical lambda and Y\nlambda_example = 3.5  # example lambda value\nY_example = [0, 2, 3, 1, 0]  # example data points\n\n# Calculate the log-likelihood\nlog_likelihood_value = poisson_loglikelihood(lambda_example, Y_example)\nprint(\"Log-likelihood:\", log_likelihood_value)\n\nLog-likelihood: -12.468328838815792\n\n\nUsing likelihood function to plot lambda on the horizontal axis and the likelihood (or log-likelihood) on the vertical axis for a range of lambdas (use the observed number of patents as the input for Y)\n\n# Extract the 'patents' column from the blueprinty DataFrame for use as Y\nY_patents = blueprinty['patents'].values\n\n# Define a range of lambda values for plotting\nlambda_values = np.linspace(0.1, 10, 400)\n\n# Compute log-likelihood values for each lambda\nlog_likelihood_values = [poisson_loglikelihood(lmbda, Y_patents) for lmbda in lambda_values]\n\n# Plotting\nplt.figure(figsize=(10, 6))\nplt.plot(lambda_values, log_likelihood_values, label='Log-Likelihood', color='blue')\nplt.title('Log-Likelihood of Poisson Model for Various Lambda Values')\nplt.xlabel('Lambda (λ)')\nplt.ylabel('Log-Likelihood')\nplt.grid(True)\nplt.legend()\nplt.show()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFinding the MLE by optimizing the likelihood function with optim() in R or sp.optimize() in Python\n\nfrom scipy.optimize import minimize\n\n# Define the negative of the log-likelihood function since we need to minimize it\ndef negative_poisson_loglikelihood(lambda_, Y):\n    Y = np.asarray(Y)\n    log_factorial_Y = np.log(np.arange(1, Y.max() + 1)).cumsum()\n    return -np.sum(Y * np.log(lambda_) - lambda_ - np.where(Y &gt; 0, log_factorial_Y[Y - 1], 0))\n\n# Initial guess for lambda\ninitial_lambda = 1\n\n# Use scipy's minimize function to find the lambda that minimizes the negative log-likelihood\nresult = minimize(negative_poisson_loglikelihood, initial_lambda, args=(Y_patents,), bounds=[(0.1, None)])\n\n# The optimal lambda found\noptimal_lambda = result.x[0]\nresult.fun, optimal_lambda\n\n(3367.6837722351083, 3.68466641206125)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNext, we extend our simple Poisson model to a Poisson Regression Model such that \\(Y_i = \\text{Poisson}(\\lambda_i)\\) where \\(\\lambda_i = \\exp(X_i'\\beta)\\). The interpretation is that the success rate of patent awards is not constant across all firms (\\(\\lambda\\)) but rather is a function of firm characteristics \\(X_i\\). Specifically, we will use the covariates age, age squared, region, and whether the firm is a customer of Blueprinty.\nUpdating the log-likelihood function with an additional argument to take in a covariate matrix X. Also changing the parameter of the model from lambda to the beta vector. In this model, lambda must be a positive number, so we choose the inverse link function g() to be exp() so that_ \\(\\lambda_i = e^{X_i'\\beta}\\).\n\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef poisson_regression_loglikelihood(beta, Y, X):\n\n    # Compute lambda_i for each observation\n    lambda_i = np.exp(X @ beta)\n    \n    # Precompute log(Y!) for each unique Y, assuming Y is non-negative integer\n    max_Y = np.max(Y)\n    log_factorial = np.log(np.arange(1, max_Y + 1)).cumsum()\n    log_factorial = np.hstack([0, log_factorial])  # For Y = 0 case\n    \n    # Compute the log-likelihood\n    log_likelihood = Y * np.log(lambda_i) - lambda_i - log_factorial[Y]\n    return -log_likelihood.sum()\n\n# Example usage could include preparing a design matrix X, Y, and an initial beta estimate, then calling an optimizer.\n\nUsing the function along with R’s optim() or Python’s sp.optimize() to find the MLE vector and the Hessian of the Poisson model with covariates.\nSpecifically, the first column of X should be all 1’s to enable a constant term in the model, and the subsequent columns should be age, age squared, binary variables for all but one of the regions, and the binary customer variable.

Age Squared: Negative and statistically significant, indicating a decrease in patent growth rate as firms get older. Region Variables: Differences across regions are observed, with Northeast showing a positive and significant effect. Is Customer: Positive and significant, suggesting that being a Blueprinty customer is associated with a higher count of patents.\nConclusions About Blueprinty’s Software The analysis strongly suggests that Blueprinty’s software has a positive effect on the success rate of patent applications. Firms using Blueprinty’s software tend to have higher patent counts than those that do not, after controlling for other factors like the age of the firm and regional influences. This finding supports the marketing claim that using Blueprinty’s software can enhance a firm’s success in securing patents."

The plot reveals a right-skewed distribution, meaning most of the Airbnb listings have only a few reviews, while a small number of listings have accumulated many reviews. This skewness suggests that while a vast majority of listings are less frequently reviewed, a select few are highly popular, receiving significant attention from guests.\n\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nimport seaborn as sns\n\n# Setting up the visualization\nplt.figure(figsize=(14, 10))\n\n# Histogram of number of reviews\nplt.subplot(2, 2, 1)\nsns.histplot(cleaned_airbnb_data['number_of_reviews'], bins=50, kde=False)\nplt.title('Histogram of Number of Reviews')\nplt.xlabel('Number of Reviews')\nplt.ylabel('Frequency')\n\nplt.xticks(rotation=45)  # Rotates labels to 45 degrees\n\nplt.tight_layout()\nplt.show()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHistogram of Prices\nThe histogram of prices (limited to listings priced at $1000 or less per night for clarity) shows a right-skewed distribution as well. The majority of the listings are priced at the lower end of the spectrum, indicating affordability and targeting budget travelers. There are fewer listings at higher price points, indicating luxury or premium offerings, which are less common but still present in the market.\n\n# Histogram of prices\nplt.figure(figsize=(14, 10))\n\nplt.subplot(2, 2, 2)\nsns.histplot(cleaned_airbnb_data[cleaned_airbnb_data['price'] &lt;= 1000]['price'], bins=50, kde=False)  # Limiting to 1000 for better visualization\nplt.title('Histogram of Prices')\nplt.xlabel('Price ($ per night)')\nplt.ylabel('Frequency')\n\nplt.xticks(rotation=45)  # Rotates labels to 45 degrees\n\nplt.tight_layout()\nplt.show()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBar Plot of Room Types\nThis bar plot categorizes the listings into three types: Entire homes/apartments, Private rooms, and Shared rooms. The visualization clearly shows that entire homes/apartments are the most common type of listing on Airbnb, followed by private rooms, and then a smaller number of shared rooms. This suggests that travelers prefer renting entire places or private rooms over shared accommodations, likely due to privacy concerns and the nature of travel (e.g., tourism, family trips, business).\n\n# Bar plot of room types\nplt.figure(figsize=(14, 10))\n\nplt.subplot(2, 2, 3)\nsns.countplot(x='room_type', data=cleaned_airbnb_data)\nplt.title('Count of Room Types')\nplt.xlabel('Room Type')\nplt.ylabel('Count')\n\nplt.xticks(rotation=45)  # Rotates labels to 45 degrees\n\nplt.tight_layout()\nplt.show()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBoxplot of Review Scores\nThis boxplot displays the distribution of review scores across three categories: cleanliness, location, and value. Each category generally scores high, with medians close to the top of the scale, which suggests that guests are typically satisfied with the cleanliness, location, and value they receive. The interquartile range (IQR) is tight for each score, indicating consistent high ratings, but there are outliers present, showing that some listings do receive lower scores occasionally.\n\n# Boxplot for review scores\nplt.figure(figsize=(14, 10))\nplt.subplot(2, 2, 4)\nsns.boxplot(data=cleaned_airbnb_data[['review_scores_cleanliness', 'review_scores_location', 'review_scores_value']])\nplt.title('Boxplot of Review Scores')\nplt.xlabel('Review Score Types')\nplt.ylabel('Scores')\n\nplt.xticks(rotation=45)  # Rotates labels to 45 degrees\n\nplt.tight_layout()\nplt.show()"

This could be due to the popularity and availability of entire homes for groups and families.\nInstant Bookability: Listings that can be instantly booked receive more reviews, suggesting higher turnover and guest preference for convenience.\nPrice Sensitivity: There is a slight negative impact of price on reviews, indicating that more expensive listings might be less frequently booked or less frequently reviewed.\nReview Scores: Interestingly, while cleanliness scores positively influence the number of reviews, high scores in location and value negatively impact reviews. This could suggest that expectations might be higher in better-located or higher-value properties, or it might reflect a complex interaction with other unobserved factors."
